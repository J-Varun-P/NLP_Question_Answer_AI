# NLP_Question_Answer_AI (CS50 AI)

## Question Answer AI based on Inverse Document Frequency

The Question Answer AI will perform two tasks: document retrieval and Passage retrieval.

The AI will have access to a corpus of text documents.

When presented with a query (a question in English asked by the user), document retrieval will first identify which document(s) are most relevant to the query.

Once the top documents are found, the top document(s) will be subdivided into passages (in this case, sentences) so that the most relevant passage to the question can be determined.
